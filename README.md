# Description of the project Mar de Dudas

The Mar de Dudas project has been carried out to meet the needs of the Mar de Niebla Social Action Foundation, which needed an application in which teachers could offer their students knowledge control questionnaires, but they wanted to do it in a way that students could interact on each question.
The teacher sends a question that the students receive on their pc to answer it, then the teacher corrects and explains the correct answer and the students will not be able to see the next question until the teacher sends the next question again.

***
## General characteristics of the project:

There are two types of users: admin and user, the admins will be the teachers and the users will be the students.
Teachers will be able to: create questions, create users, create random tests, see all the generated tests, send the questions of each test to the students, see the final statistics of said test.
